# SDL2_2D_RayCaster

FLAWLESS RAYCASTING!

![Demo](https://github.com/Nytra/SDL2_2D_RayCaster/blob/master/raycastingBest1.gif)

Below are some gifs recorded at various stages of development. You can see the different techniques that I used throughout. Only the above gif demonstrates the use of actual line-intersect geometry.

Raycasting but with a larger gap between point checks. Results in some rays penetrating the solid walls and in some cases even ignoring the walls altogether. It is way faster though and results in more rays being casted (not sure why) I think it produces a cool effect though.

And raycasting with a smaller gap between point checks.

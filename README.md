# SDL2_2D_RayCaster

![Demo](https://github.com/Nytra/SDL2_2D_RayCaster/blob/master/raycasting1.gif)

Raycasting but with a larger gap between point checks. Results in some rays penetrating the solid walls and in some cases even ignoring the walls altogether. It is way faster though and results in more rays being casted (not sure why) I think it produces a cool effect though.
